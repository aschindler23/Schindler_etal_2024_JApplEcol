- `count`: number of Greenland white-fronted geese counted
- `lat_scale`: (scaled) latitude of the corresponding wintering flock
- `lon_scale`: (scaled) longitude of the corresponding wintering flock
- `grass`: % grassland cover within a 15km radius of the corresponding wintering flock
- `cereal`: % cereal crop cover within a 15km radius of the corresponding wintering flock
- `peat_bog`: % peat bog cover within a 15km radius of the corresponding wintering flock
- `ndvi`: % average NDVI within a 15km radius of the corresponding wintering flock
- `spring_storm_days`: number of days with a severe storm during spring migration
- `spring_precip`: cumulative precipitation during spring staging
- `pre_breed_freeze`: number of days below freezing during the pre-breeding period
- `post_breed_precip`: cumulative precipitation during the post breeding period
- `fall_storm_days`: number of days with a severe storm during fall migration
- `fall_freeze`: number of days below freezing during fall staging
